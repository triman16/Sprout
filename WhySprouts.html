  <h2>Did you know?</h2>
  <p style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">India is poised for a green jobs bonanza, with the potential to create 35 million new opportunities by 2047! But wait, there's a twist! While this green wave promises exciting careers, a recent survey revealed only 45.3% of Indian graduates possess the essential skills for sustainability and green technologies. Demand for green skills surges (9.2% growth), but the worker pool lags (5.4% growth). We face a skills gap as green jobs grow faster than green workers. We need to invest in green skills now to create a sustainable economy.</p>
