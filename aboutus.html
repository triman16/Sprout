      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>My journey in creating this project was prompted by a desire to kindle hope in youngsters like myself who often feel lost and aimless amidst the intense academic competition in India. Many of these young individuals possess incredible potential, yet it becomes buried under the weight of daily struggles. To put it differently, I was a high school student brimming with ideas and grand aspirations.</p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>My goal is to delve deep into the root causes of problems rather than offering superficial solutions. Regarding my project, I want to empower young individuals with the knowledge of green skills, effective communication abilities, and, perhaps most importantly, the unwavering belief that they are capable of achieving anything, by removing the resistance they have between what they are and what they can be. This newfound confidence will enable them to face challenges head-on, even issues as daunting as climate change.</p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a foundation year student at Thapar School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, pursuing BSc in Cognitive Science and Data Science. My dream is to become a speech language pathologist who helps children with autism and other neurodivergent disorders improve their communication and social skills. My purpose is to explore, learn, and grow continuously. I have a passion for volunteering and serving others, which is why I joined Pratigya Abhiyan, a society at my university itself that teaches underprivileged children every day. Teaching children brings me joy and happiness, and I love seeing their eagerness to learn. Their recognition and gratitude motivate me to come every day.</p>
